## Problem Statement

mo status returns minimal output. No context retrieved
mo status
ðŸ“Š Current Status
Workspace: MomoAI-nx
Directory: .
Module: None

mo status
ðŸ“Š Current Status
Workspace: momo-logger
Directory: .
Module: None

## Research Question

How can we improve, what data is available?

## Context

As Momo evolves, the need for comprehensive status reporting becomes crucial. The current `mo status` command provides minimal information, which limits the user's ability to understand the system's state and available resources. Enhancing this command to include more detailed context and statistics will improve user experience and operational efficiency.

## Success Criteria

1. The `mo status` command should provide a more detailed overview of the current workspace, including:

   - Active modules and their statuses
   - Resource utilization metrics (CPU, GPU, memory)
   - Any ongoing tasks or processes

2. User feedback should indicate improved satisfaction with the status reporting capabilities.

3. The implementation should not introduce significant performance overhead.

## Initial Thoughts

1. Investigate the current implementation of the `mo status` command to identify areas for improvement.
2. Consider leveraging existing monitoring tools or libraries to gather more comprehensive system metrics.
3. Explore ways to present the additional information in a user-friendly manner, such as using tables or visualizations.
