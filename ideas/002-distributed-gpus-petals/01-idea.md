## Problem Statement

Momo has a clear need for multi-level model inference support. Usual Consumer PC's will not be able to execute all models required to run super complex tasks (As of 2025). We need to be able to distribute the inference load across multiple GPUs, potentially across different machines.

## Research Question

How can we effectively distribute model inference tasks across multiple GPUs and machines to optimize performance and resource utilization?

## Context

As AI models grow in complexity and size, the demand for computational resources increases. By 2025, consumer-grade PCs may struggle to handle the inference requirements of advanced models. Distributing the workload across multiple GPUs and machines can help alleviate this bottleneck, enabling more efficient processing and faster response times.

## Success Criteria

Are ecosystems like https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals#connect-your-gpu-and-increase-petals-capacity viable solutions for our needs?

## Initial Thoughts

1. Investigate the architecture of existing solutions like Petals to understand their approach to GPU distribution.
2. Consider the potential challenges of integrating multiple GPUs across different machines, such as network latency and data consistency.
3. Explore the possibility of using containerization (e.g., Docker) to simplify the deployment and scaling of GPU resources.
