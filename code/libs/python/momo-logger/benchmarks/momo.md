# Momo Logger Benchmarks

This directory contains performance benchmarks for the momo-logger module. The benchmarks measure logging performance across different scenarios including:

- Basic logging performance with different log levels
- Performance across different backends (console, file, buffer)
- Performance with different formatters (text, JSON, AI)
- Concurrent logging scenarios
- Context management overhead

The benchmarks help ensure the logger maintains high performance suitable for multi-agent AI systems.
