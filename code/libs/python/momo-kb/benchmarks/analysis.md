   - **Problem**: JSON serialization overhead
   - **Solution**: Binary protobuf format
   - **Expected Impact**: 30-50% storage/network efficiency
   - **Implementation**: 3-4 days

5. **Persistent Storage Backend**

   - **Implementation**: 2-3 weeks

8. **Natural Language Query Interface**
   - **Problem**: Requires structured queries
   - **Solution**: LLM-powered query translation
   - **Expected Impact**: Better agent usability
   - **Implementation**: 1-2 weeks

9. **Git/DVC Integration**
   - **Problem**: No version control integration
   - **Solution**: Automatic commits, branch support
   - **Expected Impact**: DevOps workflow integration
   - **Implementation**: 1-2 weeks

## üèÅ **Immediate Next Steps (Recommended)**

### **Week 1: Query Performance Boost**
1. **Day 1-2**: Implement property indexing system
