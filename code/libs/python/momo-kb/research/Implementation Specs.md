Momo KnowledgeBase – Final Implementation Specification

1. Overview
   The Momo KnowledgeBase (KB) is a high-performance, multi-agent, shared knowledge graph designed for both long-term and short-term contextual memory. It is optimized for:

Low footprint on fresh installs

Fast in-domain queries

Flexible pruning strategies

Immutable, versioned data for rollback

Multi-agent and (optional) multi-machine support

Built-in Git/DVC integration for persistence, audit, and sync

2. Core Principles & Architecture Decisions
   2.1 Immutable Data Model
   No updates — only INSERT and DELETE operations.

Each change is recorded as a diff (add/remove nodes/edges).

Rollback = applying reverse diffs.

Benefits:

Simplifies rollback (only apply/remove diffs).

Full auditability for debugging agent behavior.

Avoids mutation-related bugs in multi-agent environments.

2.2 Multi-Tier Storage & Pruning
We use three storage tiers for performance and resource efficiency:

Cold Storage – historical data, infrequently accessed.

Long-term archive.

Stored on disk or in distributed object storage.

Compression enabled.

Store Layer – warm, general-access knowledge.

Indexed for query performance.

Contains most of the KB except very old/unreferenced data.

Runtime KB – hot in-memory graph.

Only stores context currently in active use.

Pruned aggressively for speed.

Pruning Strategy:

Usage Metrics: Track retrieval frequency and recency for every node/edge.

Layered Pruning: Move from runtime → store → cold storage based on thresholds.

Tunable Rules:

Global/User-Level settings (data-backed optimizations updated periodically).

Runtime Auto-Adjust settings per-agent/session.

Analytics & Benchmarking: Continuous tracking to refine pruning parameters.

3. Versioning & Rollback
   Diff Model: Every KB operation produces a diff file (immutable record).

Rollback API:

python
Kopieren
Bearbeiten
KB.roll(-n) # Roll back n steps
KB.roll_to(timestamp) # Roll back to a specific point in time
Diff Types:

insert_node

delete_node

insert_edge

delete_edge

Diffs stored sequentially for replay or rollback.

No underlying KB mutation — rollback is a reversible overlay.

4. Query Pipeline & Enrichment
   Agent-First API Design — endpoints optimized for fast agent retrieval.

Built-in Query Enrichment:

textToCypher-style translation for natural language queries.

Lightweight LLMs for disambiguation.

Context Compression:

Summarization and relevance ranking before retrieval.

Output Formats:

Protobuf (canonical, internal).

JSON (optional, debug-friendly).

5. Multi-Machine & LAN Mode
   Optional LAN/multi-node deployment.

Use a lightweight distributed graph store or replication layer.

Not the primary deployment scenario; designed for easy opt-in later.

6. Git + DVC Integration
   Purpose: Enables production KBs to have the same audit, branching, and storage control as dev environments.

Workflow:

Agents commit changes (diff files) locally.

Standard Git branching and PR flows for multi-agent contributions.

DVC manages large file storage for:

Cold storage datasets.

Versioned diffs.

Commit Strategy: Manual commits by agents to reduce overhead; automated commit optional.

7. Serialization Decision
   Chosen Format: Protobuf (internal) with optional JSON output.
   Reasoning:

High performance: smaller storage footprint, faster parsing.

Strong schema evolution support without breaking old data.

Cross-language compatibility for multi-agent ecosystems.

Easier diff serialization and replay.

Debug convenience via JSON export.

8. Example API Endpoints
   python
   Kopieren
   Bearbeiten

# Add knowledge

KB.insert_node(label="Person", properties={"name": "Alice"})
KB.insert_edge("Alice", "knows", "Bob")

# Query

KB.query("MATCH (p:Person)-[:knows]->(f) RETURN f")

# Rollback

KB.roll(-1) # Roll back last change
KB.roll_to("2025-08-01T10:00:00Z")

# Pruning

KB.prune(runtime_limit=5000, store_limit=100000)

# Export for Debugging

KB.export_json() 9. Open Questions (Stakeholder Decisions Integrated)
Conflict Resolution: No real-time conflict handling needed; last-write-wins for non-simultaneous agents.

Git/DVC Sync: Agents commit manually using standard Git flows.

Pruning Thresholds: Both global (data-optimized) and per-agent runtime pruning exist.
