# ADR Reference for momo-kb Module

This module's architectural decisions are documented in the global ADR system:

## Relevant ADRs

- **[ADR-010: Unified Knowledge Base Architecture](/docs/adr/010-unified-knowledge-base-architecture/)** - Current architecture decision
- **[ADR-011: Legacy KB Architecture](/docs/adr/011-unified-knowledge-base-architecture-legacy.md)** - Historical reference (superseded)
- **[ADR-012: Graph Backend Extraction](/docs/adr/012-graph-backend-extraction-legacy.md)** - Graph extraction legacy documentation

## ADR Policy

All architectural decisions that affect multiple modules or the system architecture are documented in `/docs/adr/` at the project root. Module-specific implementation notes should reference these global ADRs.

For module-specific implementation details not covered by ADRs, use the local `research/` directory with clear references to relevant ADRs.
