Here's a deep technical framework for implementing a "Momo-centric" knowledge base (KB) system optimized for multi-agent mono-repos, addressing your core requirements:

1. Storage Architecture: Hybrid Graph-Vector-Log System
Graph Database (Neo4j/JanusGraph)

Stores semantic relationships: (Agent)-[USES]->(Class), (Module)-[DEPENDS_ON]->(Service)

Implements hyper-property graphs for versioned relationships

Vector Store (ChromaDB + Qdrant Hybrid)

Encoder: text-embedding-3-large for code-aware embeddings

Multi-index: Separate indexes for API docs, concepts, agent capabilities

Transactional Log (Apache Kafka)

Audit trail for all KB mutations: DocumentationUpdateEvent schema with CRDT metadata

Metadata Registry (Zookeeper equivalent)

Manages agent discovery, capability declarations, and schema versioning

2. Ingestion Pipeline (On-the-Fly Processing)
python
async def ingest_artifact(artifact: Artifact):
    # Parse code without docs
    entities = CodeParser(artifact).extract_entities()
    
    # Generate embeddings in parallel
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        doc_embeddings = executor.map(EmbeddingService.generate, entities)
    
    # Build knowledge graph
    kg_builder = KnowledgeGraphBuilder(context=current_commit)
    kg = kg_builder.transform(entities, doc_embeddings)
    
    # Stream to storage
    await VectorStore.upsert(kg.embeddings)
    GraphDB.apply_delta(kg.topology)
    Kafka.produce(KBEvent(kg.metadata))
3. Retrieval System: Context-Aware Digestion
Multi-Hop Retrieval:

Vector similarity for initial context

Graph traversal for relationship expansion

Temporal filtering via Kafka event logs

Context Compression:

Transformer-based summarization (BART-Large) with agent-specific adapters

Dynamic chunking based on agent's context window (adjustable 1K-32K tokens)

4. Agent Communication Protocol
protobuf
message KnowledgeRequest {
  string agent_id = 1;
  ContextPath context_path = 2;  // e.g. "services/auth/edge_functions"
  RetrievalParams params = 3;
  bytes semantic_digest = 4;     // Hash of recent interactions
}

message KnowledgeResponse {
  repeated ContextChunk chunks = 1;
  map<string, Relation> graph_edges = 2;
  uint32 context_richness_score = 3;  // 0-100 quality metric
}
Transport: gRPC-streaming with QUIC protocol for high-churn environments

Prioritization: Deadline-aware scheduling (RT-kernel priorities)

5. Performance Optimization
Caching:

L1: Agent-local LRU cache (context-aware)

L2: Shared Redis cluster with cache invalidation via Kafka topics

Indexing:

Differential indexing: Hot data in RAM (Paimon), cold data on SSD

Just-in-time compilation for graph queries (Apache AGE)

Benchmark Targets:

95% of retrievals <50ms at 10K QPS

Sub-second graph traversals for 6-hop queries

6. Context Enrichment System
Automated Annotation:

Agent feedback loop: (Retrieval) → [Agent Usage] → (Relevance Score) → [Fine-tuning]

Hidden Markov Models for predicting context drift

Temporal Context:

Versioned knowledge slices: sys_time IN ('2024-08-10 14:00:00', COMMIT_HASH)

Automated snapshotting on semantic version boundaries

7. Deployment Workflow

Code










8. Failure Resilience
Knowledge Consistency:

Vector-graph alignment checks via cross-modal verification

Automated consistency repair using Kafka event replay

Agent Fallback:

Degraded mode with local knowledge shards

Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) for divergent knowledge

9. Security & Governance
Knowledge Signatures:

Ed25519 signatures for all KB mutations

Zero-knowledge proofs for access control

Audit Trails:

Immutable ledger of all retrievals (Apache Kafka + S3)

Differential privacy for query logs

10. Evolutionary Architecture
Schema Migration:

Protobuf-backed schema registry with automated transforms

Dual-write during migration windows

Capacity Planning:

Predictive scaling based on commit velocity

Knowledge decay modeling for retention policies

Critical Tradeoffs Considered:

Vector vs Graph: Vectors for fuzzy similarity, graphs for explicit relationships - hybrid maintains both

Freshness vs Performance: Eventual consistency model with tunable staleness

Context Richness vs Bandwidth: Progressive knowledge loading with priority streaming

Agent Autonomy vs Central Truth: Ephemeral agent knowledge caches with central KB as source-of-truth

Implementation Roadmap:

Phase 1: Build ingestion pipeline with Kafka+ChromaDB+Neo4j

Phase 2: Implement agent SDK with context management

Phase 3: Add automated documentation renderer

Phase 4: Deploy feedback loops for self-optimization

This architecture enables zero-inline-documentation development while maintaining rich, queryable knowledge. The system scales through its hybrid storage approach and agent-aware retrieval optimizations, making it particularly suitable for complex multi-agent systems requiring high-context fidelity.
