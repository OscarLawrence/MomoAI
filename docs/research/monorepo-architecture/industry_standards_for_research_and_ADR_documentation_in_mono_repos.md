### Industry Standards for Research and ADR Documentation in Monorepos

Based on extensive research across sources like GitHub repositories, official documentation from tools like Nx, and best practice guides from companies and communities (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, and monorepo tooling sites), the industry emphasizes lightweight, version-controlled documentation stored directly in the repository. This ensures it's discoverable, evolves with the code, and supports collaboration in large-scale setups like monorepos.

Key principles include:
- **Consistency and Accessibility**: Use Markdown for docs to keep them readable and searchable. Version them with the code via Git for traceability.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinguish between exploratory research (deep analysis, benchmarks), decisions (ADRs with rationale), implementation records (migration logs), and module-specific guides (e.g., READMEs).
- **Hierarchy in Monorepos**: Favor a flat or grouped structure to avoid deep nesting, which can hinder navigation. Common patterns include root-level folders for shared docs and per-project subfolders. Tools like Nx recommend grouping projects by domain (e.g., apps/ for applications, libs/ for libraries) to keep related code and docs together.
- **Best Practices for ADRs**: Introduced by Michael Nygard, ADRs are short, immutable records (amend via new files). One ADR per decision, stored in a dedicated folder like /docs/adrs/ or /decisions/. Focus on context, options, decision, and consequences to avoid "decision debt."
- **Research Documentation**: Treated as a strategic layer, often in a /research/ or /docs/research/ folder. It includes benchmarks, evaluations, and scientific backing, feeding into ADRs. Standards stress making it reusable (e.g., via templates) and linking it to code changes.

| Aspect                  | Common Industry Standards                                                                 | Your Current Setup Alignment | Suggested Improvements |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Research Layer**     | Dedicated folder (e.g., /research/) for deep analyses like tech evaluations, benchmarks (e.g., vector DBs vs. traditional). Use templates for consistency; link to ADRs. Examples: Google's monorepo practices include research docs for perf studies. | Strong: /research/ with examples like package manager analysis. | Consolidate scattered research here; add subfolders (e.g., /research/ai-agents/) for domain-specific topics. Require templates: Problem, Methodology, Findings, Recommendations. |
| **ADR Layer**          | /docs/ or /adrs/ folder with Markdown files. Standard template: Title, Status (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated), Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives Considered. One file per decision; immutable. | Good: /docs/ with decision tree pattern (Problem, Research, Decision, Plan, Metrics). | Enhance template with "Alternatives" and "Consequences" sections for fuller rationale. Use status tags; store in /docs/adrs/ subfolder for clarity in large monorepos. |
| **Implementation/Migration Records** | /migrations/ or /changelogs/ for logs, scripts, outcomes. Include success/failure metrics; version with Git. | Excellent: /migrations/ with dated files and scripts. | Add post-mortems (e.g., "Lessons Learned") to each file; integrate with CI/CD for auto-generating logs. |
| **Module-Specific Docs** | Per-project README.md, plus specialized files (e.g., API.md). In monorepos, group by domain (e.g., libs/shared/ui/README.md). | Solid: Per-module files like CLAUDE.md, momo.md, README.md. | Standardize across modules (e.g., require sections: Overview, Usage, Dependencies). Add /libs/shared/ for cross-agent reusable docs. |
| **Overall Hierarchy**  | Root: /apps/, /libs/, /docs/, /tools/. Group by scope (e.g., /libs/booking/); avoid deep nesting. Nx: Use generators to move/remove projects. | Aligned: /research/, /docs/, /migrations/, /libs/python/*/. | Adopt Nx-recommended grouping (e.g., /libs/agents/ for multi-agent modules). Add root /README.md outlining the hierarchy. |

### Adapting to Your Multi-Agent System

Multi-agent AI systems (e.g., involving agents like Claude or custom LLMs) introduce complexity around orchestration, roles, and interactions. Industry standards from frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, and OpenAI emphasize modularity, clear boundaries, and robust documentation to handle agent coordination, error recovery, and scalability.

#### Key Best Practices for Multi-Agent Systems
From sources like OpenAI's agent-building guide and Anthropic's research:
1. **Assign Clear Roles**: Define specialized agents (e.g., one for research, one for decision-making) to avoid overload. Use a "manager" agent for orchestration.
2. **Local Memory Management**: Keep agent memory isolated to prevent global state issues; use tools for shared data.
3. **Error Handling and Guardrails**: Implement retries, human-in-the-loop for high-risk actions, and layered safeguards (e.g., PII filters).
4. **Tool Design**: Agents should have well-defined, reusable tools (e.g., APIs for data retrieval). Test thoroughly and version them.
5. **Incremental Building**: Start with single agents, then scale to multi-agent; use loops for task execution until completion.
6. **Orchestration Patterns**: Central "manager" for unified control or decentralized handoffs for flexibility.
7. **Simplicity and Transparency**: Show planning steps; use advanced models for complex reasoning.
8. **Validation and Iteration**: Use evals for accuracy; monitor real-world performance.

#### Documentation Adaptations
- **Integrate with Existing Hierarchy**: Extend /research/ for agent-specific analyses (e.g., "Agent Orchestration Benchmarks"). Use /docs/ for ADRs like "ADR: Adopt Decentralized Pattern for Multi-Agent Coordination."
- **Agent-Specific Docs**: In /libs/python/momo-kb/, add files like AGENT_ROLES.md (defining interactions) and TOOLS.md (tool specs). For shared agents, create /libs/shared/agents/ with reusable docs.
- **Leverage Existing Docs for Agents**: Convert procedures (e.g., migration plans) into LLM-friendly instructions for agents. Document edge cases and guardrails explicitly.
- **Flow Enhancements**: Update your decision tree to include agent validation: Research → ADR → Implementation → Agent Testing (e.g., in /migrations/ add agent-run logs).
- **Cleanup Scattered Docs**: Audit the repo; migrate old research to /research/. Use Nx tools to reorganize folders without breaking builds.

This setup will make your monorepo more maintainable, reduce mess, and better support multi-agent development by ensuring docs guide agent design and evolution. If you share more details on your agents (e.g., specific frameworks), I can refine further.
