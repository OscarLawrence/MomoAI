# ADR-007 Implementation Plan: Standardize Scientific Agent Workflow Patterns

## Implementation Overview

Create **momo-agent** module as unified AI agent framework that integrates existing proven systems (momo-workflow, momo-mom, ADR) into a cohesive, testable platform for multi-step task completion with any AI model.

**Architecture**: Orchestration layer connecting:
- **momo-workflow**: Scientific protocols, benchmarking, reversible operations
- **momo-mom**: Command abstraction, fallback strategies, shell integration  
- **ADR system**: Structured decision-making for architectural tasks

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Core Framework Development
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Dependencies:** Existing momo-workflow and momo-mom modules

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create momo-agent module with standard nx+uv+Python structure
- [ ] Implement AgentTask and AgentWorkflow protocols based on momo-workflow
- [ ] Create AgentCommandExecutor wrapping momo-mom functionality
- [ ] Build WorkflowEngine for multi-step task orchestration
- [ ] Add scientific measurement collection (timing, success rates)
- [ ] Implement state management and persistence
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite with unit and e2e tests
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking infrastructure

**Success Criteria:**
- Module passes all tests with >95% coverage
- Successfully executes simple multi-step workflows
- Integrates cleanly with momo-workflow protocols
- Command execution works with momo-mom fallback strategies

### Phase 2: AI Model Integration & Local Testing
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete, local AI model environment setup

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Design abstract AI interface supporting multiple model types
- [ ] Implement local model integration (Ollama, local OpenAI compatible)
- [ ] Create task completion validation and quality assessment
- [ ] Build prompt engineering system for structured workflows
- [ ] Add error handling and retry mechanisms for AI interactions
- [ ] Create standard test task battery (module creation, testing, debugging)
- [ ] Implement cross-model consistency testing
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking vs manual task completion
- [ ] Create local model setup documentation

**Success Criteria:**
- Framework successfully tested with ≥2 local AI models
- >90% task success rate on standard repository tasks
- Identical tasks produce consistent results across models
- Performance benchmarking shows measurable improvements

### Phase 3: Integration & Advanced Features
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks  
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 complete, validated local model testing

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Integrate with existing ADR workflow system
- [ ] Add automatic task complexity assessment (simple vs ADR-worthy)
- [ ] Implement workflow pattern analysis and recommendations
- [ ] Create comprehensive usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Add integration with CLAUDE.md and momo.md patterns
- [ ] Build cross-model performance comparison tools
- [ ] Create framework extension documentation
- [ ] Add advanced error recovery and rollback testing

**Success Criteria:**
- Seamless integration with existing workflow systems
- Clear documentation and examples for framework usage
- Validated framework extensibility for new AI models
- Performance optimization based on measurement data

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Local Model Performance Variability
**Probability:** High **Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** Design AI-agnostic interface with performance adaptation. Include model capability detection and task routing. Provide fallback to simpler execution modes.

### Risk 2: Integration Complexity with Existing Systems
**Probability:** Medium **Impact:** High
**Mitigation:** Thorough integration testing with each existing system. Start with minimal viable integration and expand incrementally. Maintain fallback to manual processes.

### Risk 3: Framework Adoption Barriers
**Probability:** Medium **Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:** Extensive documentation and examples. Clear migration path from existing patterns. Demonstrate value through benchmarking and efficiency gains.

## Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- **Code Quality**: >95% test coverage, passing all linting and type checks
- **Performance**: Framework overhead <5% of total task execution time
- **Integration**: Successful integration with all existing workflow systems
- **Documentation**: Complete usage examples and API documentation

### Validation Metrics  
- **Multi-Model Support**: Tested with ≥3 different AI model types
- **Task Success Rate**: >90% success on standard repository task battery
- **Reproducibility**: >95% consistency across different model executions
- **Performance Improvement**: 25% reduction in task completion time vs manual

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- All protocols and interfaces thoroughly tested
- Mock AI model integration for deterministic testing
- Command execution integration with mocked momo-mom
- State management and persistence validation

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end workflow execution with real local models
- Cross-system integration (momo-workflow, momo-mom, ADR)
- Error recovery and rollback scenarios
- Performance benchmarking against manual execution

### Validation Testing
- Standard task battery: module creation, testing, debugging, refactoring
- Cross-model consistency validation  
- Command failure recovery testing
- Workflow rollback and state restoration

## Rollback Plan

### Level 1: Framework Issues
- Disable momo-agent module, fallback to existing individual systems
- Preserve existing momo-workflow, momo-mom, ADR functionality
- No impact on current development workflows

### Level 2: Integration Problems
- Revert to pre-integration state of existing modules
- Use git branch isolation during development to minimize impact
- Maintain compatibility layers during development phase

### Level 3: Complete Rollback
- Remove momo-agent module entirely
- Restore all existing systems to pre-implementation state
- Document lessons learned for future attempts

**Recovery Time**: <1 hour for any rollback level due to modular design and git branch isolation
