# ADR-007 Research: Standardize Scientific Agent Workflow Patterns

**Date:** 2025-08-11

## Research Methodology

Comprehensive analysis of existing repository workflow patterns:
1. **Repository Structure Analysis** - Examined monorepo architecture, module organization, testing patterns
2. **Workflow Documentation Review** - Analyzed existing ADR workflow system, momo-workflow module, agent implementations  
3. **Pain Point Identification** - Investigated workflow-analysis.md findings from ADR-006 momo-graph extraction
4. **Best Practice Research** - Reviewed scientific development standards from CLAUDE.md requirements

## Problem Analysis

### Current State

**Multi-Agent Architecture** with **loosely integrated workflow components**:
- **ADR Workflow System** (`scripts/adr-workflow.py`): Well-structured 6-phase lifecycle for architectural decisions
- **momo-workflow Module**: Scientific workflow abstraction with protocols, reversible operations, and benchmarking
- **momo-mom Command System**: Universal command mapping with shell-first architecture and fallback strategies  
- **Module Development Pattern**: Standardized nx+uv+Python with mandatory workflow (format → lint → typecheck → test-fast)

**Gap**: No unified framework connecting these systems for **general AI agent task completion**

### Pain Points

**1. Disconnected Workflow Systems**
- ADR system excellent for architectural decisions but heavyweight for general tasks
- momo-workflow has scientific rigor but lacks integration with command execution
- momo-mom provides command abstraction but no structured task management
- No bridge between these systems for AI agents to follow

**2. Missing AI Agent Framework**
- No standardized way for AI agents to decompose and execute arbitrary tasks
- Limited guidance for AI agents on when to use which workflow system
- No structured approach for multi-step task completion with validation
- Insufficient error recovery and rollback mechanisms for AI agent workflows

**3. Incomplete Scientific Measurement**  
- momo-workflow has benchmarking but not integrated with actual agent task execution
- No metrics collection for real AI agent performance across different task types
- Limited reproducibility of AI agent decision chains
- Missing validation framework for AI agent workflow effectiveness

**4. Command Integration Gaps**
- momo-mom command system exists but not integrated with workflow management
- Complex nx command syntax still exposed despite abstraction layer
- No automatic command recovery integrated with workflow rollback
- Limited fallback strategies for AI agent command execution failures

### Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- **F1**: Unified AI Agent Framework connecting momo-workflow, momo-mom, and ADR systems
- **F2**: Multi-step task decomposition with automatic validation and rollback  
- **F3**: Command execution integration with fallback strategies and error recovery
- **F4**: Scientific measurement of AI agent performance across task types
- **F5**: Local model testing capability for framework validation

**Non-functional Requirements:**
- **NF1**: Scientific rigor - all workflows benchmarked and measurable
- **NF2**: AI-agnostic design - works with any AI model (local or API)
- **NF3**: Minimal overhead - lightweight integration with existing systems
- **NF4**: Reproducibility - identical tasks produce consistent results across different AI agents

## Solution Research

### Option 1: Unified Agent Framework (momo-agent)

**Description:** Create new `momo-agent` module that integrates momo-workflow protocols with momo-mom command execution

**Pros:**
- Leverages existing momo-workflow scientific rigor and protocol design
- Integrates momo-mom command abstraction with structured task management
- Can connect to ADR system for complex architectural tasks
- Purpose-built for AI agent multi-step task completion
- Supports both local and API-based AI models

**Cons:**
- New module creation overhead
- Requires integration testing across multiple existing systems
- Learning curve for understanding the unified framework

**Implementation Effort:** High

### Option 2: Extend momo-workflow with Agent Integration

**Description:** Enhance existing momo-workflow module with AI agent task patterns and command integration

**Pros:**
- Builds on proven scientific workflow foundation
- Already has reversible operations and benchmarking
- Protocol-based design supports AI agent extensions
- Existing test suite and performance measurement

**Cons:**
- momo-workflow may not be designed for interactive AI agent usage
- Limited command execution integration currently
- May require significant changes to existing module architecture

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

### Option 3: Enhance momo-mom with Workflow Patterns

**Description:** Extend momo-mom command system with structured workflow management capabilities

**Pros:**
- Builds on existing command abstraction and fallback strategies
- AI agents already interact with command systems naturally  
- Shell-first architecture aligns with AI agent execution patterns
- Minimal disruption to existing command usage

**Cons:**
- momo-mom focused on command mapping, not workflow management
- Missing scientific measurement and benchmarking capabilities
- Limited rollback and state management features
- May dilute the focused purpose of momo-mom

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

## Comparative Analysis

| Criteria | Unified Framework | Extend momo-workflow | Enhance momo-mom |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Scientific Rigor** | Very High | Very High | Medium |
| **AI Agent Suitability** | Very High | Medium | High |
| **Implementation Cost** | High | Medium | Medium |
| **Integration Complexity** | High | Medium | Low |
| **Command Execution** | Very High | Low | Very High |
| **Workflow Management** | Very High | Very High | Low |
| **Local Model Testing** | Very High | High | Medium |

## Recommendation

**Option 1: Unified Agent Framework (momo-agent)**

**Rationale**: 
- **Comprehensive Solution**: Addresses all requirements by combining the best of existing systems
- **AI Agent Focused**: Purpose-built for multi-step AI agent task completion
- **Scientific Foundation**: Leverages momo-workflow's proven protocols and measurement
- **Command Integration**: Incorporates momo-mom's command abstraction and fallback strategies
- **Testable Framework**: Designed for validation with local models and benchmarking

**Implementation Strategy**:
Create `momo-agent` module that serves as orchestration layer:
- **Task Decomposition**: Uses momo-workflow protocols for structured, reversible task management
- **Command Execution**: Integrates momo-mom for reliable command execution with fallbacks  
- **Decision Documentation**: Connects to ADR system for architectural decisions
- **Performance Measurement**: Built-in benchmarking and scientific measurement
- **Local Model Support**: Framework designed for testing with any AI model (local or API)
