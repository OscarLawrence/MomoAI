# ADR-007 Research: Standardize Scientific Agent Workflow Patterns

**Date:** 2025-08-11

## Research Methodology

Comprehensive analysis of existing repository workflow patterns:
1. **Repository Structure Analysis** - Examined monorepo architecture, module organization, testing patterns
2. **Workflow Documentation Review** - Analyzed existing ADR workflow system, momo-workflow module, agent implementations  
3. **Pain Point Identification** - Investigated workflow-analysis.md findings from ADR-006 momo-graph extraction
4. **Best Practice Research** - Reviewed scientific development standards from CLAUDE.md requirements

## Problem Analysis

### Current State

**Multi-Agent Architecture** with **heterogeneous workflow patterns**:
- **ADR Workflow System**: Structured 6-phase lifecycle (research → draft → planning → implementation → finalizing → complete)
- **Module Development**: Standardized nx+uv+Python pattern with MANDATORY workflow (format → lint → typecheck → test-fast)
- **Command Execution**: `momo-mom` universal command mapping with shell-first architecture and fallback strategies
- **Agent Task Management**: **Missing structured approach** - agents work ad-hoc without standardized task decomposition

### Pain Points

**1. Inconsistent Agent Task Documentation**
- No standardized way to capture agent decision-making process
- Task decomposition varies between agents and sessions  
- Difficult to reproduce agent workflows or learn from past decisions
- TodoWrite tool usage is inconsistent across different agent types

**2. Command Complexity vs Scientific Rigor**
- Complex nx command syntax (`nx g @nxlv/python:uv-project`) vs simple commands (`mom create python`)
- Cache corruption issues requiring manual recovery (`nx reset`)
- Inconsistent command patterns causing workflow disruption

**3. Missing Scientific Workflow Standards**
- No standardized metrics for agent task performance
- Limited reproducibility of agent decision chains
- Insufficient validation of agent workflow effectiveness
- Lack of benchmarking for different workflow approaches

**4. Documentation Fragmentation**
- Agent context scattered across multiple file types (CLAUDE.md, momo.md, research/, ADRs)
- No systematic way to track agent learning or improvement over time
- Missing integration between different workflow systems

### Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
- **F1**: Structured agent task decomposition with phase tracking
- **F2**: Standardized agent decision documentation 
- **F3**: Reproducible agent workflows with rollback capability
- **F4**: Performance metrics and benchmarking for agent tasks
- **F5**: Integration with existing ADR and module development workflows

**Non-functional Requirements:**
- **NF1**: Scientific rigor - all agent decisions backed by measurable criteria
- **NF2**: Long-term maintainability - workflows must evolve with codebase
- **NF3**: Efficiency - minimal overhead for agent task management
- **NF4**: Consistency - standardized patterns across all agent types

## Solution Research

### Option 1: Extend Existing ADR Workflow System

**Description:** Enhance the current 6-phase ADR workflow to support agent task management

**Pros:**
- Leverages proven 6-phase structured approach
- Already integrated with git branching and PR creation
- Has state tracking via `.workflow-state.json`
- Template-based documentation generation

**Cons:**
- ADR system designed for architectural decisions, not general tasks
- Heavy overhead for simple agent tasks
- Requires branching for every task (workflow disruption)
- Limited integration with TodoWrite tool usage patterns

**Implementation Effort:** Medium

### Option 2: Standalone Agent Workflow System

**Description:** Create dedicated agent workflow system based on momo-workflow module with scientific measurement

**Pros:**
- Purpose-built for agent task management
- Scientific approach with metrics collection and benchmarking
- Protocol-based design allows extensibility
- Reversible operations with rollback capability
- Integrates with existing TodoWrite patterns

**Cons:**
- Additional system complexity
- Requires learning new workflow patterns
- May fragment documentation across multiple systems
- Initial implementation overhead

**Implementation Effort:** High

### Option 3: Enhanced TodoWrite Integration

**Description:** Extend TodoWrite tool with structured workflow phases and scientific measurement

**Pros:**
- Builds on existing tool agents already use
- Minimal learning curve and adoption friction
- Can add metrics without changing core workflow
- Easy integration with existing command patterns

**Cons:**
- TodoWrite may not be suited for complex workflow management
- Limited rollback and state management capabilities
- May not scale to advanced workflow requirements
- Missing integration with documentation generation

**Implementation Effort:** Low

## Comparative Analysis

| Criteria | ADR Extension | Standalone System | TodoWrite Enhancement |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Scientific Rigor** | High | Very High | Medium |
| **Implementation Cost** | Medium | High | Low |
| **Integration Complexity** | Low | High | Very Low |
| **Scalability** | Medium | High | Low |
| **Agent Adoption** | Medium | Low | High |
| **Long-term Maintainability** | High | Very High | Medium |

## Recommendation

**Hybrid Approach: Enhanced TodoWrite + Workflow Documentation Standards**

**Phase 1**: Enhance TodoWrite with structured workflow patterns
- Add workflow phase tracking (research, planning, execution, validation)
- Implement scientific metrics collection (time tracking, success rates)
- Create standardized task decomposition templates
- Add integration with existing command systems (mom, nx)

**Phase 2**: Develop workflow documentation standards
- Standardized agent decision documentation
- Integration with existing CLAUDE.md and momo.md patterns
- Automatic workflow result capture and analysis
- Performance benchmarking across different agent types

This approach maximizes agent adoption while maintaining scientific rigor and long-term scalability.
