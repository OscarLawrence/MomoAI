## Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Agents in the MomoAI mono-repo lack **standardized workflow patterns** for task decomposition, decision documentation, and scientific measurement. This leads to inconsistent agent behavior, non-reproducible workflows, and inability to learn from past agent sessions.

**Core Issues**:
1. **Ad-hoc task management** - agents decompose tasks differently across sessions
2. **Inconsistent documentation** - no standard way to capture agent reasoning
3. **Missing scientific rigor** - no metrics or benchmarking of agent effectiveness
4. **Workflow fragmentation** - multiple disconnected systems (ADR, TodoWrite, module development)

## Research Summary

### Key Findings

**Current Workflow Ecosystem Analysis**:
- **ADR System**: Excellent for architectural decisions with 6-phase structured approach, but heavyweight for general tasks
- **TodoWrite Tool**: Widely adopted by agents but lacks scientific measurement and structured phases
- **momo-workflow Module**: Scientific approach with protocol-based design, but not yet integrated with agent patterns
- **Command Systems**: `momo-mom` provides excellent shell-first architecture, but agent workflow integration missing

**Pain Points Identified**:
- Command complexity vs simplicity tension (`nx g @nxlv/python:uv-project` vs `mom create python`)
- Cache corruption issues requiring manual recovery
- Documentation scattered across multiple file types
- No systematic learning from agent workflows

### Current State Analysis

**Strengths to Preserve**:
- Robust ADR system for architectural decisions
- Scientific development standards (format → lint → typecheck → test-fast)
- Universal command mapping with fallback strategies
- Comprehensive testing and benchmarking culture

**Gaps to Address**:
- Missing structured agent task decomposition
- No standardized agent decision documentation
- Limited workflow reproducibility and rollback
- Insufficient performance metrics for agent tasks

## Decision

**DECISION: Implement Hybrid Agent Workflow System**

**Adopt Enhanced TodoWrite Integration with Scientific Workflow Standards**

**Core Decision**: Extend the existing TodoWrite tool with structured workflow patterns while developing complementary workflow documentation standards. This preserves agent adoption momentum while introducing scientific rigor incrementally.

## Implementation Strategy

**Two-Phase Implementation Approach**

### Phase 1: Enhanced TodoWrite Core (Immediate)
1. **Structured Task Decomposition**
   - Add workflow phases to TodoWrite: `research` → `planning` → `execution` → `validation` → `completed`
   - Implement task templates for common agent patterns (module creation, debugging, testing)
   - Add task complexity estimation and deadline tracking

2. **Scientific Measurement Integration**  
   - Add time tracking for task phases and overall completion
   - Implement success rate metrics (% of tasks completed successfully)
   - Add command execution tracking and failure analysis
   - Create simple performance benchmarking for agent workflows

3. **Command System Integration**
   - Integrate TodoWrite with `momo-mom` command execution
   - Add automatic task status updates when commands succeed/fail
   - Implement command fallback tracking and recovery metrics

### Phase 2: Workflow Documentation Standards (Follow-up)
1. **Agent Decision Documentation**
   - Standardized workflow result templates
   - Integration with existing CLAUDE.md and momo.md patterns
   - Automatic capture of key decisions and reasoning

2. **Learning and Improvement System**
   - Workflow pattern analysis across different agent sessions
   - Best practice identification and recommendation
   - Performance comparison between different approach strategies

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Workflow rollback and state management
   - Cross-agent workflow coordination
   - Integration with existing ADR system for major decisions

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Agent Adoption Rate**: >80% of agent sessions use structured TodoWrite within 30 days
- **Task Completion Efficiency**: 20% reduction in average task completion time
- **Workflow Reproducibility**: 90% of documented workflows can be reproduced by different agents
- **Command Success Rate**: <5% cache corruption or command failure incidents

### Qualitative Metrics  
- **Consistency**: Standardized task decomposition patterns across all agent types
- **Scientific Rigor**: All agent decisions backed by measurable criteria and documentation
- **Learning Capability**: Clear evidence of workflow improvement over time
- **Integration**: Seamless workflow between TodoWrite, command systems, and documentation

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Agent Adoption Resistance
**Probability**: Medium **Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**: Start with minimal changes to existing TodoWrite patterns. Make enhancements optional initially. Focus on adding value without changing core workflow.

### Risk 2: Performance Overhead  
**Probability**: Low **Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Implement measurements asynchronously. Use sampling for performance metrics. Provide opt-out for resource-constrained environments.

### Risk 3: Complexity Creep
**Probability**: High **Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Strict adherence to "simplicity first" principle. Regular review of feature additions. User feedback prioritization over feature completeness.

### Risk 4: Integration Conflicts
**Probability**: Medium **Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Thorough testing with existing workflow systems. Gradual rollout with fallback options. Clear version compatibility management.

## Trade-offs Accepted

### What We Gain
- **Standardized Agent Workflows**: Consistent, reproducible task management across all agents
- **Scientific Rigor**: Measurable agent performance with continuous improvement
- **Simplified Command Execution**: Integration with `momo-mom` reduces command complexity
- **Learning Capability**: Systematic capture and reuse of successful workflow patterns

### What We Give Up  
- **Absolute Simplicity**: TodoWrite becomes slightly more complex with additional features
- **Complete Flexibility**: Some standardization limits agent workflow creativity
- **Immediate Perfection**: Incremental approach means some features delivered later
- **Universal Coverage**: Focus on TodoWrite may not address all workflow management needs

**Rationale**: The benefits of structured, measurable agent workflows significantly outweigh the costs of modest complexity increase. The incremental approach minimizes risk while delivering immediate value.
