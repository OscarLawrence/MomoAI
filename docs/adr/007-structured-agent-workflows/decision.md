## Problem Statement

**Challenge**: Agents in the MomoAI mono-repo lack **standardized workflow patterns** for task decomposition, decision documentation, and scientific measurement. This leads to inconsistent agent behavior, non-reproducible workflows, and inability to learn from past agent sessions.

**Core Issues**:
1. **Ad-hoc task management** - agents decompose tasks differently across sessions
2. **Inconsistent documentation** - no standard way to capture agent reasoning
3. **Missing scientific rigor** - no metrics or benchmarking of agent effectiveness
4. **Workflow fragmentation** - multiple disconnected systems (ADR, momo-workflow, momo-mom, module development)

## Research Summary

### Key Findings

**Current Workflow Ecosystem Analysis**:
- **ADR System**: Excellent for architectural decisions with 6-phase structured approach, but heavyweight for general tasks
- **momo-workflow Module**: Scientific approach with protocol-based design, but not yet integrated with agent task execution patterns
- **Command Systems**: `momo-mom` provides excellent shell-first architecture, but agent workflow integration missing

**Pain Points Identified**:
- Command complexity vs simplicity tension (`nx g @nxlv/python:uv-project` vs `mom create python`)
- Cache corruption issues requiring manual recovery
- Documentation scattered across multiple file types
- No systematic learning from agent workflows

### Current State Analysis

**Strengths to Preserve**:
- Robust ADR system for architectural decisions
- Scientific development standards (format → lint → typecheck → test-fast)
- Universal command mapping with fallback strategies
- Comprehensive testing and benchmarking culture

**Gaps to Address**:
- Missing structured agent task decomposition
- No standardized agent decision documentation
- Limited workflow reproducibility and rollback
- Insufficient performance metrics for agent tasks

## Decision

**DECISION: Create Unified AI Agent Framework (momo-agent)**

**Build momo-agent module integrating momo-workflow + momo-mom + ADR systems**

**Core Decision**: Create a new `momo-agent` module that serves as the orchestration layer for AI agent task completion. This framework will connect existing proven systems (momo-workflow's scientific protocols, momo-mom's command abstraction, ADR's structured decision-making) into a cohesive, testable system for any AI model.

## Implementation Strategy

**Three-Phase Framework Development**

### Phase 1: Core momo-agent Framework
1. **Create momo-agent Module**
   - Standard nx+uv+Python module following repository conventions
   - Core AgentTask and AgentWorkflow protocols based on momo-workflow patterns
   - Integration layer for momo-mom command execution
   - Basic task decomposition with validation and rollback

2. **Command Integration**
   - AgentCommandExecutor wrapping momo-mom functionality
   - Automatic fallback strategies and error recovery
   - Command success/failure tracking with workflow state updates
   - Integration with existing nx command patterns

3. **Workflow Protocols**
   - TaskStep protocol with execute() and rollback() methods
   - WorkflowEngine for multi-step task orchestration
   - Scientific measurement collection (timing, success rates, resource usage)
   - State management and persistence

### Phase 2: AI Model Integration & Testing
1. **Local Model Support**
   - Abstract AI interface supporting multiple model types (local, API)
   - Task completion validation and quality assessment
   - Prompt engineering for structured workflow execution
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms

2. **Benchmarking Framework**
   - Standard test tasks for AI agent performance measurement
   - Comparative analysis between different AI models
   - Workflow effectiveness metrics and optimization
   - Reproducibility testing across model types

3. **Integration Testing**
   - End-to-end workflow validation with local models
   - Performance benchmarking against manual task completion
   - Error recovery and rollback testing
   - Command execution reliability validation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Documentation
1. **ADR System Integration**
   - Automatic promotion of complex tasks to ADR workflow
   - Decision documentation and architectural impact analysis
   - Integration with existing ADR branch management

2. **Learning and Optimization**
   - Workflow pattern analysis and recommendation
   - Performance optimization based on measurement data
   - Best practice identification across different task types

3. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Comprehensive usage examples and patterns
   - Integration with existing CLAUDE.md and momo.md systems
   - Tutorial for setting up local model testing

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Framework Adoption**: momo-agent successfully integrated and tested with ≥3 different AI models
- **Task Success Rate**: >90% success rate for standard repository tasks (module creation, testing, code changes)
- **Performance Improvement**: 25% reduction in task completion time vs manual execution
- **Reproducibility**: Identical tasks produce consistent results across different AI models >95% of the time
- **Command Reliability**: <2% command execution failures after fallback strategies

### Qualitative Metrics  
- **Local Model Compatibility**: Framework successfully tested with local models (e.g., Ollama, local OpenAI)
- **Scientific Rigor**: All workflows benchmarked with measurable performance criteria
- **Integration Quality**: Seamless connection between momo-workflow, momo-mom, and ADR systems
- **Developer Experience**: Clear, documented patterns for extending framework with new AI models

### Validation Tests
- **Standard Task Battery**: Module creation, testing, debugging, code refactoring
- **Error Recovery**: Workflow rollback and recovery from command failures
- **Cross-Model Consistency**: Same task executed identically across different AI models
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Scientific measurement of workflow effectiveness

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Integration Complexity
**Probability**: High **Impact**: High  
**Mitigation**: Start with minimal viable framework focusing on core protocols. Thorough integration testing with existing systems. Incremental rollout with fallback to manual processes.

### Risk 2: Local Model Performance
**Probability**: Medium **Impact**: Medium
**Mitigation**: Design framework to be AI-agnostic with performance adaptation. Include fallback to simpler models or manual execution. Comprehensive benchmarking to identify optimal model requirements.

### Risk 3: Framework Adoption Barriers
**Probability**: Medium **Impact**: High
**Mitigation**: Extensive documentation and examples. Gradual migration path from existing patterns. Focus on demonstrable value through benchmarking and efficiency gains.

### Risk 4: Maintenance Overhead
**Probability**: Medium **Impact**: Medium  
**Mitigation**: Leverage existing proven systems rather than rebuilding. Design for modularity and loose coupling. Comprehensive test coverage and automated validation.

## Trade-offs Accepted

### What We Gain
- **Unified AI Agent Framework**: Single system connecting all workflow components
- **Local Model Testing**: Ability to validate framework with any AI model type
- **Scientific Measurement**: Comprehensive benchmarking and performance optimization
- **Reproducible Workflows**: Consistent task execution across different AI agents
- **Command Reliability**: Robust execution with fallback strategies and error recovery

### What We Give Up  
- **Implementation Simplicity**: New module creation requires significant development effort
- **Immediate Availability**: Framework requires development before benefits realized
- **System Simplicity**: Additional integration complexity across multiple existing systems
- **Flexibility**: Standardized patterns may limit some creative workflow approaches

**Rationale**: The long-term benefits of a unified, testable AI agent framework justify the upfront development investment. The framework enables scientific validation and optimization that's impossible with current ad-hoc approaches.
