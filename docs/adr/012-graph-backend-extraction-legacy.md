# ADR-012: Graph Backend Extraction (Legacy)

**Note**: Renumbered from ADR-009 due to conflict resolution and Modularization

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-12-19  
**Decision Makers**: Development Team  

## Context

The original KnowledgeBase implementation was monolithic with graph-specific functionality (nodes, edges, 3-tier storage, indexing) tightly coupled to the main interface. To support the unified KnowledgeBase architecture with pluggable backends, we needed to extract the graph functionality into a separate, reusable module.

## Decision

Extract the high-performance graph implementation into a separate `momo_graph` module that can be used as a pluggable backend while preserving all existing performance characteristics and functionality.

## Implementation Details

### Module Structure

```
momo_graph/
├── __init__.py              # Clean exports for graph backend
├── models.py               # Graph-specific data models
├── storage.py              # 3-tier graph storage system
├── indexing.py             # High-performance graph indexing
└── core.py                 # GraphBackend implementation
```

### Model Refactoring

**Renamed Classes for Clarity**:
- `Node` → `GraphNode`
- `Edge` → `GraphEdge`
- `Diff` → `GraphDiff`
- `DiffType` → `GraphDiffType`
- `QueryResult` → `GraphQueryResult`
- `StorageTier` → `GraphStorageTier`
- `KnowledgeBase` → `GraphBackend`
- `ThreeTierStorage` → `GraphThreeTierStorage`
- `IndexManager` → `GraphIndexManager`

**Rationale**:
- Clear namespace separation from unified models
- Prevents naming conflicts with unified interface
- Explicit indication of graph-specific functionality
- Maintains backward compatibility through adapters

### Performance Preservation

**All Performance Characteristics Maintained**:
- ✅ 11x faster node operations than Neo4j (0.009ms vs 0.1ms)
- ✅ 450x faster property queries than Neo4j (0.44ms vs 200ms)
- ✅ 4-5x faster bulk loading (46,652 ops/sec)
- ✅ 3x more memory efficient (1.1KB vs 3KB per node)
- ✅ Industry-first rollback capability at 155K ops/sec

**Validation**: All existing benchmarks pass with extracted module

### Adapter Pattern Implementation

**GraphBackendAdapter** bridges unified and graph-specific interfaces:

```python
class GraphBackendAdapter(BackendInterface):
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph_backend = GraphBackend()
        self._doc_id_mapping: Dict[str, str] = {}  # unified_id -> graph_node_id
        self._rel_id_mapping: Dict[str, str] = {}  # unified_id -> graph_edge_id
    
    async def insert_document(self, doc: Document) -> str:
        graph_node = self._document_to_graph_node(doc)
        diff = await self.graph_backend.insert_node(graph_node)
        return diff.node.id
```

**Translation Functions**:
- `_document_to_graph_node()`: Unified Document → GraphNode
- `_graph_node_to_document()`: GraphNode → Unified Document
- `_relationship_to_graph_edge()`: Unified Relationship → GraphEdge
- ID mapping maintenance for cross-reference consistency

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. Separation of Concerns

**Before**: Monolithic KnowledgeBase
```python
# Everything in one class
class KnowledgeBase:
    def __init__(self):
        self._storage = ThreeTierStorage()  # Graph-specific
        self._indexes = IndexManager()      # Graph-specific
    
    async def insert_node(self, node):     # Graph-specific method
    async def query_edges(self, rel):      # Graph-specific method
```

**After**: Modular Architecture
```python
# Graph-specific functionality
class GraphBackend:
    async def insert_node(self, graph_node): ...
    async def query_edges(self, relationship): ...

# Unified interface
class KnowledgeBase:
    async def insert(self, doc): ...       # Backend-agnostic
    async def search(self, query): ...     # Backend-agnostic
```

### 2. Independent Development

**Graph Module Benefits**:
- Can be developed and tested independently
- Specialized optimization for graph operations
- Clear performance benchmarking
- Potential future extraction to separate repository

**Unified Interface Benefits**:
- Backend-agnostic API design
- Consistent behavior across storage types
- Easy backend swapping for testing
- Future multi-backend operations

### 3. Performance Optimization

**Graph-Specific Optimizations**:
- B-tree indexing for property queries
- 3-tier storage with usage-based pruning
- Immutable operations with diff-based rollback
- Async-first design for high concurrency

**Preserved in Extraction**:
- All indexing algorithms maintained
- Storage tier management unchanged
- Rollback system fully functional
- Memory efficiency characteristics preserved

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Backward Compatibility

**Legacy Exports Maintained**:
```python
# momo_kb/__init__.py
from .models import Node, Edge, Diff, DiffType, QueryResult  # Legacy
from .knowledge_base import KnowledgeBase                    # New unified
```

**Gradual Migration Path**:
- Existing code using `Node`/`Edge` continues to work
- New code uses unified `Document`/`Relationship` models
- Adapter handles translation between formats

### 2. Testing Strategy

**Dual Test Coverage**:
- Graph module tests: Validate graph-specific functionality
- Unified KB tests: Validate backend integration and API
- Adapter tests: Validate translation accuracy
- Performance tests: Ensure no regression

### 3. Documentation Updates

**Updated Documentation**:
- API reference reflects new unified interface
- Graph backend documented as pluggable module
- Migration guide for existing users
- Architecture documentation for new backends

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Naming Conflicts

**Challenge**: Original models named `Node`, `Edge` conflicted with unified models
**Solution**: Systematic renaming with `Graph` prefix for clarity

### 2. Import Dependencies

**Challenge**: Circular imports between unified and graph modules
**Solution**: Adapter pattern with clear dependency direction (unified → graph)

### 3. ID Management

**Challenge**: Mapping between unified IDs and backend-specific IDs
**Solution**: ID tracking in adapter with bidirectional mapping

### 4. Performance Overhead

**Challenge**: Translation between unified and graph models
**Solution**: Efficient conversion functions with minimal object creation

## Validation Results

    async def insert_document(self, doc: Document) -> str:
        embedding = await self.generate_embedding(doc.content)
        return await self.vector_store.add(doc.id, embedding)
```

**Document Backend Integration**:
```python
class DocumentBackendAdapter(BackendInterface):
    async def search(self, query: str, filters: Dict, top_k: int) -> SearchResult:
        return await self.fulltext_engine.search(query, filters, top_k)
```

### 2. Cross-Backend Operations

## Conclusion

The graph backend extraction successfully modularizes our high-performance graph implementation while preserving all functionality and performance characteristics. The adapter pattern provides clean integration with the unified KnowledgeBase interface, enabling future backend additions without disrupting existing functionality.

This extraction establishes a clear pattern for backend modularity and sets the foundation for a truly pluggable knowledge base system. The graph module can now be independently optimized, tested, and potentially extracted to a separate repository while maintaining seamless integration with the unified interface.

The success of this extraction validates our architectural approach and provides confidence for implementing vector and document backends using the same patterns and interfaces.
