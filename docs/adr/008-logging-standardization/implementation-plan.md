# ADR-008 Implementation Plan: Standardize Logging Architecture

## Implementation Overview

Migrate all MomoAI modules to use **momo-logger** as unified logging infrastructure with standardized agent-aware patterns, trace correlation, and comprehensive observability across the multi-agent system.

**Architecture**: Centralized structured logging with:
- **momo-logger**: Core infrastructure with AI-optimized levels and rich metadata
- **Agent context**: Standardized agent identification and role-based logging
- **Trace correlation**: Workflow tracking across module boundaries
- **Performance measurement**: Built-in metrics for continuous optimization

## Phase Breakdown

**Duration:** 2 weeks  
**Dependencies:** Existing momo-logger module, comprehensive analysis complete

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **momo-agent Integration**
  - Add momo-logger dependency to pyproject.toml
  - Replace logging.getLogger() calls with get_logger() from momo-logger
  - Implement agent-aware logging in AgentWorkflowEngine with DEVELOPER/TESTER levels
  - Add trace correlation for multi-step agent task execution
  - Convert command executor logging to use AI_AGENT level

- [ ] **momo-workflow Integration**  
  - Add momo-logger dependency and update scientific workflow tracking
  - Replace WorkflowEngine logging with structured metadata capture
  - Use AI_SYSTEM level for workflow orchestration logs
  - Implement performance metadata logging for benchmark correlation
  - Add rollback operation logging with structured failure context

- [ ] **momo-mom Integration**
  - Add momo-logger dependency to agent communication modules
  - Replace standard logging with AI_AGENT level for inter-agent communication
  - Implement command execution tracing with performance data
  - Add error recovery logging with structured failure analysis
  - Create agent context propagation patterns

**Success Criteria:**
- All three modules pass existing test suites with new logging
- Performance overhead <2% compared to standard logging
- Successful trace correlation demonstrated across modules
- Agent context properly propagated in multi-agent scenarios

### Phase 2: Graph Module and Print Statement Replacement
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete, patterns established

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **momo-graph Module Migration**
  - Add momo-logger dependency and initialization patterns
  - Replace all print statements with appropriate logging levels
  - Use AI_USER level for user-facing messages in scripts
  - Implement graph operation logging with node/edge metrics
  - Add performance tracking for graph operations

- [ ] **Script Standardization Across Modules**
  - Create standardized logging initialization for all example scripts
  - Replace print statements with user-facing AI_USER logs
  - Implement consistent error handling patterns
  - Add execution performance tracking for benchmarking

- [ ] **Documentation and Example Updates**
  - Update all CLAUDE.md files with logging best practices
  - Create logging examples in script files
  - Add structured logging to README examples
  - Update integration guides across modules

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero print statements remaining in production code paths
- All scripts use consistent logging initialization
- User-facing messages properly use AI_USER level
- Performance tracking available for all major operations

### Phase 3: Advanced Observability Infrastructure
**Duration:** 1 week  
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 complete, all modules integrated

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Trace Correlation Infrastructure**
  - Implement consistent trace_id generation and propagation
  - Create correlation patterns for multi-agent workflows
  - Add distributed tracing support for complex operations
  - Build log aggregation and correlation tools

- [ ] **Agent Context Middleware**
  - Create automatic agent context injection for workflows
  - Implement role-based logging configuration management
  - Add performance threshold monitoring and alerting
  - Build structured log analysis and visualization tools

- [ ] **Migration Tooling and Advanced Features**
  - Create automated validation scripts for logging consistency
  - Build comprehensive performance comparison tools
  - Add advanced debugging and analysis capabilities
  - Create observability best practices documentation

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete trace correlation for multi-agent workflows
- Automated logging pattern validation across all modules
- Performance monitoring and analysis infrastructure operational
- Advanced debugging capabilities demonstrated with real scenarios

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Async Integration Complexity
**Probability:** Medium **Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** momo-logger designed async-first. Start with existing async modules (momo-store-document pattern). Create comprehensive async logging examples. Test thoroughly before full rollout.

### Risk 2: Performance Regression
**Probability:** Low **Impact:** High  
**Mitigation:** Continuous benchmarking during integration. momo-logger already performance-optimized. Implement rollback plan if overhead exceeds 2%. Use performance comparison tools.

### Risk 3: Developer Adoption Resistance
**Probability:** Medium **Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** Demonstrate clear debugging benefits early. Create excellent documentation and migration guides. Show real-world observability improvements with concrete examples.

### Risk 4: Migration Completeness
**Probability:** Medium **Impact:** Medium  
**Mitigation:** Automated validation tools to detect inconsistent patterns. Comprehensive test coverage for all integration scenarios. Phased rollout with validation at each step.

## Success Metrics

### Development Metrics
- **Code quality**: All modules pass linting, typing, and test suites
- **Performance**: <2% overhead compared to existing logging approaches
- **Coverage**: 100% of modules using momo-logger consistently
- **Integration**: Successful trace correlation across all module boundaries

### Validation Metrics
- **Multi-agent tracing**: Complete workflow traces across module boundaries
- **Observability**: Rich structured metadata available for all operations
- **Debugging**: Simplified debugging experience with unified logging
- **Performance**: Sub-millisecond logging overhead in critical paths

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Testing
- **Cross-module workflow tracing** with complete trace correlation
- **Performance benchmarking** across all integration scenarios
- **Error handling validation** with structured failure context
- **Agent context propagation** in multi-agent workflow scenarios

### Validation Testing
- **Automated logging pattern validation** across all modules
- **Performance regression testing** with continuous monitoring
- **Backward compatibility** during migration periods
- **Observability feature testing** with real debugging scenarios

## Rollback Plan

### Level 1: Module-Specific Issues
- Keep existing logging imports as fallbacks during migration
- Rollback individual module integration while maintaining overall progress
- Use conditional imports for gradual migration

### Level 2: Performance Issues
- Implement performance monitoring with automatic rollback triggers
- Maintain performance comparison baselines
- Quick rollback to standard logging if overhead exceeds thresholds

### Level 3: Complete Rollback
- Automated restoration scripts for all logging call sites
- Comprehensive backup of pre-migration logging patterns
- Full regression testing to ensure stability

**Recovery Time**: <1 hour for any rollback level due to phased approach and automated tooling
