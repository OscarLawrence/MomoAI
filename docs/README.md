## Current Architecture Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Migrations
- **Nx Monorepo Setup**: Full workspace conversion complete
- **Python Package Management**: All 5 modules migrated from PDM ‚Üí uv
- **Development Workflow**: Standardized `nx run` commands across all modules
- **Tooling Integration**: pyright, pytest, ruff all working via Nx

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Components
- **5 Python Modules**: momo-kb, momo-logger, momo-graph-store, momo-vector-store, momo-store-document
- **3 Node.js Applications**: web (Nuxt.js), cli (Node.js), core (Python core system)
- **Development Tooling**: Nx orchestration with uv package management
- **Performance**: 10-35x improvement in dependency management speed

## Development Workflow

### Standard Commands (All Modules)
```bash
# Development workflow
nx run {module}:install      # Install dependencies (uv sync)
nx run {module}:format       # Code formatting (ruff)
nx run {module}:typecheck    # Type checking (pyright)
nx run {module}:test-fast    # Fast tests (unit + e2e)

# Quality assurance
nx run {module}:test-all     # Complete test suite with coverage
nx run {module}:benchmark    # Performance benchmarks
nx run {module}:lint         # Code style checking

# Batch operations
nx run-many -t format        # Format all modules
nx affected -t test-fast     # Test only changed modules
```

## Key Principles

### Scientific Approach
- **Research-Driven**: Every major decision backed by thorough analysis
- **Performance-First**: Benchmarks validate all technology choices
- **Documentation-Complete**: Full decision trail from research to implementation

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Protocol-Based Design**: Runtime backend swapping for flexibility
- **Modular Components**: Self-contained modules with clear interfaces
- **Intelligent Coordination**: Nx orchestration mirrors agent coordination patterns

### Development Excellence
- **Consistent Tooling**: Identical commands across all modules
- **Type Safety**: Full pyright integration across Python modules
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automated benchmarking and regression detection
- **AI-Friendly Documentation**: CLAUDE.md files provide development context

## Next Steps

### Immediate Development
- Begin implementing core multi-agent functionality in `apps/core/`
- Integrate Python modules into unified agent system
- Establish inter-agent communication protocols

### Architecture Evolution
- Monitor performance characteristics as system scales
- Evaluate additional storage backends based on usage patterns
- Expand benchmarking to cover multi-agent coordination metrics
